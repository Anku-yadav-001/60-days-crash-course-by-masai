### Overview
This assignment introduces you to setting up a React project using Create React App (CRA). You will create a basic React application from scratch, gaining familiarity with the project structure and essential concepts of React development. This project aims to provide a solid foundation for building React applications by guiding you through the initial setup process.

### Detailed Explanation
#### Topics
Setting up a React project with Create React App (CRA)
Understanding the project structure generated by CRA
Running and testing a React application locally
### Setup Guidelines and Instructions
1. Environment Setup: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).
2. Creating a New React Project with CRA: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create a new React project named "my-react-app":
npx create-react-app my-react-app

3. Running the React Application: Navigate to the newly created project directory and start the development server by running the following commands:
```
cd my-react-app
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open your default web browser to view your React application.

### Problem Statement
Setting up the React Project: Use Create React App to initialize a new React project named "my-react-app".
Exploring the Project Structure: Examine the files and folders generated by Create React App to understand the project structure.
Running the Application Locally: Start the development server and ensure that you can view the default React application in your web browser.
Create a basic counter application
Follow the proper component structure

### Submission Guidelines
1. Push your code to GitHub and share the GitHub repository link.
2. Ensure that your React application runs without errors and follows the standard project structure generated by Create React App.
3. Include any additional observations or learnings in the README.md file of your project.
