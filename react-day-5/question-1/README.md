### Overview
This assignment introduces you to handling side effects in React using the useEffect hook. You will learn how to perform tasks such as fetching data from an API, subscribing to external events, or updating the document title in response to component lifecycle events. By mastering the useEffect hook, you will gain a deeper understanding of managing side effects in React applications.

### Detailed Explanation
#### Topics
1. Understanding side effects in React
2. Introducing the useEffect hook
3. Handling asynchronous operations and subscriptions
4. Cleanup operations and dependencies in useEffect

### Setup Guidelines and Instructions
1. Environment Setup: Ensure you have a modern web browser installed (such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) to view the output of your React component. No specific IDE is required; you can use any text editor of your choice (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.) for writing your code.
2. Setting up a New React Project: You can either create a new React project using Create React App (CRA) or use an existing React project for this assignment.
3. Understanding the useEffect Hook: Familiarise yourself with the useEffect hook in React and its syntax. Refer to the official React documentation or online tutorials for guidance.

### Problem Statement
1. Fetching Data from an API: Create a React component that fetches data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder, REST Countries API, etc.) using the useEffect hook. Display the fetched data in your component.

2. Subscribing to External Events: Implement a React component that subscribes to a browser event (e.g., mouse movement, keyboard input, etc.) using the useEffect hook. Log the event data to the console or update the component state accordingly.

```Refer this : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/clientX```

3. Updating the Document Title: Develop a React component that updates the document title dynamically based on component lifecycle events (e.g., componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate) using the useEffect hook.

### Submission Guidelines
Push your code to GitHub and share the GitHub repository link.
Ensure that your React components demonstrate the proper use of the useEffect hook to handle side effects.
Include any additional observations or learnings in the README.md file of your project.
